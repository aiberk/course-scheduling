# Vagrant
To run this in your system:

Open your command prompt and type:

git clone https://github.com/fernandoaestrella/Skunkworks-Course-Scheduling/tree/master

Or you could clone from Github Desktop.
Then, in the command prompt, change directory (cd) into the new folder. It might look something like:

cd repo/Vagrant

And then run:

vagrant up
